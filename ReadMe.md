# Tricky's modules for BlitzMax

I wrote these modules for my own benefit, however if you have use for them, go ahead, use them as you please, however before you do, please read the license terms which should be included in each module.

Please note, this repository is updated real-time as soon as the tiniest update is done my building script will update this repository automatically. Therefore I can never guarantee these updates work the way they should. Always keep that in mind.



If reporting a bug or any other issue, keep the next stuff in mind.

1. Make sure I'm not working on the module in question. If a module is updated less than 24h ago I might still be working on the specific module.
2. NEVER forget WHICH specific module contains the bug or any other kind of issue. It makes my life a lot easier if I don't have to check all modules to find out what you are talking about.

Final note:
You may modify these modules as you please as long as its in accordance with the license set up for that module. It's however not a good idea to upload your modified versions to this repository (even if you only did a bugfix). This repository is only a copy of my real stuff, and thus my next update will very likely overwrite your modifications (my builder is completely automated and merciless, I'm sorry).
