This Module is just a quick Module that can help setting up index files For files And folders.<br>
This Module has been set up To Create these files For "foreign" formats JCR6 will support.<br>
In the first place only For JCR6's zip module, because the zipstream module can't give the filelists of the zip file, which is required for JCR6 to operate properly.<br>
My intension is To make "RealDir", "WAD", "Quake Pack" And "TAR" support this in order To make these files also benefit from the advancements JCR6 offers over other formats.
Please note that in my own BlitzMax projects JCR6 will always be my own primary format. L&Ouml;VE2D will always need zip due To the way it has been written.
I am experimenting with New languages, but there too JCR6 will be my aim point. Why use this Long way around when JCR6 offers what other formats do Not offer by Default :P
