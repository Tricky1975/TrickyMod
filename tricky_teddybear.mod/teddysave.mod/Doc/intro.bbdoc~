Teddybear is a simple 2D map tile engine. It comes in two modules TeddyBear and TeddyBear_CoreOnly.
Teddybear is the full engine with loader and renderer, TeddyBear_CoreOnly only contains the core routines and the loader and not the drawing routines.
This may be handy if you need to render your maps differently than just in standard 2D.

NEVER import BOTH modules. Always either one or the other, otherwise you can (and most likely will) get system conflicts.

<p>Then to answer the question how Teddybear got its name, it's basically
a pun to TEd.
The TEd level editor has been used to design the levels for many famous
games, most notably the Commander Keen series,
Wolfenstein 3D and Rise of the Triad, but there are more games
designed with it.
